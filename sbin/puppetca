#
# = Synopsis
#
# Stand-alone certificate authority.  Capable of generating certificates
# but mostly meant for signing certificate requests from puppet clients.
#
# = Usage
#
#   puppet cert [-h|--help] [-V|--version] [-d|--debug] [-v|--verbose]
#               [-g|--generate] [-l|--list] [-s|--sign] [-r|--revoke]
#               [-p|--print] [-c|--clean] [--verify] [--digest DIGEST]
#               [--fingerprint] [host]
#
# = Description
#
# Because the puppetmasterd daemon defaults to not signing client certificate
# requests, this script is available for signing outstanding requests.  It
# can be used to list outstanding requests and then either sign them individually
# or sign all of them.
#
# = Options
#
# Note that any configuration parameter that's valid in the configuration file
# is also a valid long argument.  For example, 'ssldir' is a valid configuration
# parameter, so you can specify '--ssldir <directory>' as an argument.
#
# See the configuration file documentation at
# http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/reference/configref.html for
# the full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
# configuration options can also be generated by running puppet cert with
# '--genconfig'.
#
# all::
#   Operate on all items.  Currently only makes sense with '--sign',
#   '--clean', or '--list'.
#
# digest::
#   Set the digest for fingerprinting (defaults to md5). Valid values depends
#   on your openssl and openssl ruby extension version, but should contain at
#   least md5, sha1, md2, sha256.
#
# clean::
#    Remove all files related to a host from puppet cert's storage. This is
#    useful when rebuilding hosts, since new certificate signing requests
#    will only be honored if puppet cert does not have a copy of a signed
#    certificate for that host. The certificate of the host remains valid.
#    If '--all' is specified then all host certificates, both signed and
#    unsigned, will be removed.
#
# debug::
#   Enable full debugging.
#
# generate::
#   Generate a certificate for a named client.  A certificate/keypair will be
#   generated for each client named on the command line.
#
# help::
#   Print this help message
#
# list::
#   List outstanding certificate requests.  If '--all' is specified,
#   signed certificates are also listed, prefixed by '+', and revoked
#   or invalid certificates are prefixed by '-' (the verification outcome
#   is printed in parenthesis).
#
# print::
#   Print the full-text version of a host's certificate.
#
# fingerprint::
#   Print the DIGEST (defaults to md5) fingerprint of a host's certificate.
#
# revoke::
#   Revoke the certificate of a client. The certificate can be specified
#   either by its serial number, given as a decimal number or a hexadecimal
#   number prefixed by '0x', or by its hostname. The certificate is revoked
#   by adding it to the Certificate Revocation List given by the 'cacrl'
#   config parameter. Note that the puppetmasterd needs to be restarted
#   after revoking certificates.
#
# sign::
#   Sign an outstanding certificate request.  Unless '--all' is specified,
#   hosts must be listed after all flags.
#
# verbose::
#   Enable verbosity.
#
# version::
#   Print the puppet version number and exit.
#
# verify::
#   Verify the named certificate against the local CA certificate.
#
# = Example
#
#   $ puppet cert -l
#   culain.madstop.com
#   $ puppet cert -s culain.madstop.com
