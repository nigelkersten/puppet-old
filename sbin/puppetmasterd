# = Options
#
# Note that any configuration parameter that's valid in the configuration file
# is also a valid long argument.  For example, 'ssldir' is a valid configuration
# parameter, so you can specify '--ssldir <directory>' as an argument.
#
# See the configuration file documentation at
# http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/ConfigurationReference for
# the full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
# configuration options can also be generated by running puppetmasterdd with
# '--genconfig'.
