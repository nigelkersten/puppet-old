# are recieved.
#
# = Options
#

# parameter, so you can specify '--server <servername>' as an argument.

# http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/ConfigurationReference for
# the full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
# configuration options can also be generated by running puppetd with
# '--genconfig'.
